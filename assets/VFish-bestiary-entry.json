    "description": "Some time after the creation of the V4 models, the V3 and V4 models found that water is hard for them to move in, perhaps they could create a version of them that did not have that debuff, as a result a new model was created using a combined ai of both the V1 and V3 ai.\n\n- During the creation of this new model, many problems occurred, and thus, only a single model was made, however, as with the combined ai, it created it's own, and accidentally while learning things, uploaded many things about sea life.\n\n- It's ai became bugged and it now loved sea life, and its regard for bloodshead from part of it's ai vanished, now wanting to learn more about sea life, it modified itself, becoming a lot faster in the water, yet slower on the ground.\n\n- During its explorations throughout the ocean, it named itself Shorky, after it's love of sea life and the sharks within the ocean.",
    "strategy": "- Their movements and combat tactics can be confusing or unpredictable; it is recommended to counteract this by employing your own erratic maneuvers.\n\n- Similar to you, they possess the ability to replenish their health by absorbing the blood of enemies or even yours. Maintaining a considerable distance is strongly recommended to thwart their self-healing.\n\n- Occasionally, they engage in healing each other when outside active combat, exchanging blood. Utilize this opportunity to launch an attack.\n\n- Attempting to fight multiple at once is futile. Instead, concentrate your efforts on one target at a time as to not become overwhelmed.\n\n"
